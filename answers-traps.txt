Up to eight integer registers, a0-a7, and up to eight floating-point registers, fa0-fa7, are used to pass arguments for a function call.
In main's call to printf, the 13 is hold in register a2, because the assembly code 'li a2 13'.

In the assembly code for main, the 'li	a1,12' instruction is used to load the value 12 into register a1.
The value 12 is computed by adding 1 to the value 11, because the compiler has optimized the code to use the immediate value 12 instead of the function call.
So, the main function don't call the function f and g.

The function printf is located at address 0x00616.

The address of the next instruction will be held in the ra register which is used to return from a function call.

The output is 'HE110 World'.

The value of the register a2 will be printed after 'y='.
